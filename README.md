# Planetary Conflict I - Public Docs

Planetary Conflict I is a spiritual successor to the Planetside series of games (PS1, PS2). The core goals are:

1) Create an MMOFPS with multiple warring factions and massive scale combined arms fights. Combined arms refers to a mix of infantry, ground vehicles, and aerial combat. Having
more than two factions fighting for control over a planet provides significantly more depth to conflicts.
2) Ensure consistent on-going conflict on planets. This could be through the use of AI players as well as through gamemaster driven events similar to
the Helldivers 2 gamemaster system. There is no such thing as a "match", instead planets will be locked/unlocked for war similar to the Planetside continent system.
3) Support immense scale. Systems should be designed with hundreds of players fighting over points of interest (POI, think amp station or biolab from PS2) in mind. Many techniques
from StarEngine (Star Citizen) can likely be applied to reduce loading screens/improve performance while still allowing thousands of players to exist seamlessly in a connected world.
4) Create a best-in-class social system. The game should feel like an MMO with its social features and focus on group play. Groups working together should have significant tactical advantage
over individual players. Provide in-game incentives for grouping up and working together.
5) Provide a truly excellent FPS experience. Hit reg and general combat whether infantry or vehicle should feel fluid and responsive. Having good aim and control of your weapon/vehicle should
feel rewarding and significantly impact your ability to win fights.

## Developing In Public

The `pc1-docs` repo is intentionally made public to surface information about the game development process, the design of various systems, and the general roadmap for what's to come. As the game
progresses in development, feedback and discussions of systems could happen over the docs in this repo. I'd like to incorporate interested players into the process as soon as possible.
